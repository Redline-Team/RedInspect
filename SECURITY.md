- Network communications should be secured with appropriate encryption
- Regular security audits are recommended for production deployments
- Follow your organization's security policies when deploying

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed
- Clearly marked in release notes
- Announced through our standard communication channels
- Backported to supported versions when necessary
